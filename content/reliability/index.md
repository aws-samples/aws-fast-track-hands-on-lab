## Continuous Reliability Challenges

### Scenario 
* Currently your company is facing some performance problems and would like to some performance tunning. Head of IT has tasked you to perform load testing, simulating real-life based load conditions. This solution should also include a monitoring dashboard to visualise the load test and scaling activities. 

* [Perform Load testing on the application](https://aws.amazon.com/solutions/implementations/distributed-load-testing-on-aws/)

* [Build monitoring dashboard to visualize the load test and scaling activitie](https://aws.amazon.com/solutions/implementations/distributed-load-testing-on-aws/)
